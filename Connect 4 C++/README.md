This was my very first taste of C++ coding back when I was a pre-med student at Tufts. Project was for COMP11 - Intro to Computer Science, Fall 2012.

My task was to recreate a visual representation of the classic game "Connect 4" from scratch. Meant to display proficiency with structs, 2D arrays, and function modularity.
